== Group Assignment Center

Group Assignment Center is an event management tool that easily &
quickly allows event planners to assign registrants to arbitrary
groups.  Group Assignment Center has been designed initially to work
with RO-Connector, a library for accessing the RegOnline API.  This
means that Group Assignment Center can be used as a supplement to the
event management capabilities of the RegOnline service.
